# CodiBase Stack Workspace

This workspace contains the three core components of the CodiBase stack:

## Components

1. **codibase/** - Git hosting, CI/CD, project management (forked from OneDev)
2. **vibecoda/** - Code editor for vibe coding (forked from VS Code)
3. **pilotcodi/** - AI code completion (forked from Tabby)

## Setup

Each component is a clean codebase without git history. You can now:

1. Initialize git in this workspace:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: CodiBase stack"
   ```

2. Add your remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. Start building! 🔥

## Next Steps

- Rebrand each component with CodiBase branding
- Set up development environments
- Configure integrations between components
- Build the hybrid AI routing system
